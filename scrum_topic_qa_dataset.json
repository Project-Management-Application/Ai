Scrum\nengages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or\nacquire such skills as needed.\nScrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.\nThese events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and\nadaptation.\nTransparency\nThe emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving\nthe work.

Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.\nInspection\nThe Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to\ndetect potentially undesirable variances or problems.

A\nScrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.\nScrum Values\nSuccessful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:\nCommitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage\nThe Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
